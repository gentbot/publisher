                <p>Making a local only ai agent that can complete coding
                tasks in various language and take projects from start
                to finish. How would such a system work? What are the
                required pieces needed to make it function well? How can
                it be extended to add more capabilities?</p>

                <li>It should have the ability to code in multiple
                languages and iterate on simple ideas.</li>
                <li>It should have the ability to plan projects and
                write a project requirements document in order to
                faithfully execute the intended application.</li>
                <li>It should have the ability to point out where errors
                in logic or poorly defined requirements and expectations
                have been found.</li>

                <p>Voice mode - This will be a full speech to speech
                style interface that will encapsulate all the
                functionalities of the agent. This would allow for voice
                interaction with the agent to plan and execute on any
                idea at any time. - The voice mode should adjust how
                output is given. I will give notifications on long
                running tasks. Check in on progress and generally
                refrain from reciting every single word and step of a
                process unless asked. Soft launch or sandbox running of
                any project created using the agent. THe agent should be
                able to test if the project is in a runnable state. If
                it is not it should proactively try to fix any mistakes
                and run it again, as long as it remains below a max
                retry limit. Once that is reached it should ask for
                help.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this is not to make the most state of
                the art agent. It is instead to gain a better
                understanding of how to make and maintain some of these
                systems. How to add functionality and how to adequately
                customize them for multiple situations.</p>

                <li>System fragility, as iteration takes time even

                <li>So far the first version is pretty awful and simple
                to contain, but there is a possibility that given access
                to a computer the option for it to find a way outside of
                the main project directory and cause harm to the
                underlying system.</li>

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Making a local only ai agent that can complete coding tasks in
various language and take projects from start to finish. How would such
a system work? What are the required pieces needed to make it function
well? How can it be extended to add more capabilities?</p>
<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create an ai agent that can be run from the terminal.</li>
<li>It should have the ability to code in multiple languages and iterate
on simple ideas.</li>
<li>It should have the ability to plan projects and write a project
requirements document in order to faithfully execute the intended
application.</li>
<li>It should have the ability to point out where errors in logic or
poorly defined requirements and expectations have been found.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="future-addition">Future Addition</h1>
<p>Voice mode - This will be a full speech to speech style interface
that will encapsulate all the functionalities of the agent. This would
allow for voice interaction with the agent to plan and execute on any
idea at any time. - The voice mode should adjust how output is given. I
will give notifications on long running tasks. Check in on progress and
generally refrain from reciting every single word and step of a process
unless asked. Soft launch or sandbox running of any project created
using the agent. THe agent should be able to test if the project is in a
runnable state. If it is not it should proactively try to fix any
mistakes and run it again, as long as it remains below a max retry
limit. Once that is reached it should ask for help.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why</h1>
<p>The purpose of this is not to make the most state of the art agent.
It is instead to gain a better understanding of how to make and maintain
some of these systems. How to add functionality and how to adequately
customize them for multiple situations.</p>

<h1 id="concerns">Concerns</h1>
<ul>
<li>Not knowing what I am doing at all</li>
<li>System fragility, as iteration takes time even though it is being
worked on in concert with an ai</li>
<li>So far the first version is pretty awful and simple to contain, but
there is a possibility that given access to a computer the option for it
to find a way outside of the main project directory and cause harm to
the underlying system.</li>
</ul>

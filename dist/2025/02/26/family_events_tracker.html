              <h2>A family event display</h2>
            <p>Created on: February 26, 2025</p>

<p>This family event tracker will use <code>n</code> eink displays
powered by ESP-32. They will display the local weather conditions to
help us prepare for the day and also combine all family member calendar
events for the day, or week.</p>
<h2 id="tech">tech</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go - backend to fetch weather, and events data</li>
<li>js, html, css - using the gathered information generate the ui for
the display and create the image that will be shown on the eink
displays</li>
<li>C++ - The controller for the eink display that will pull in the
saved image of the weather and events as a bitmap and displays it to the
screen.</li>
<li>imagemagick - Used to convert any screen captured image into bmp,
and bitmap array. More easily readable by the esp32</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using a cronjob the go application will fetch current weather and
calendar events ( runs every 15 minutes)</li>
<li>After fetching the data use playwright to spin up the webpage making
use of the data to generate the images of various sizes that can fit on
any eink displays in the system</li>
<li>Process the saved image captured from the webpage to ensure that it
is a 1-bit bitmap image that can be displayed on monochrome e-ink
displays</li>
<li>Every 30 minutes the e-ink displays fetch the saved image processes
it and draws it to the screen. ( to preserve battery power the esp32
goes into deep sleep after this process. IT take ~30 seconds. The esp32
does not wake to fetch data during the night. Operating hours are
between 6am and 1am every day)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concerns">concerns</h2>
<p>The esp32 is underpowered and low on memory so displaying images from
a local server comes with challenges as the specific boards being used
have a max of 500kb of memory to work with. So pulling in large image
files is not reliable. The best option is to stream the data into a
bitmap array and draw it to the display as it becomes ready. Repeating
this process until the image is complete.</p>
<p>Being new to many of the pieces, like C++ and Go it is unclear at
times if I am taking the most ideal approach to writing the code to make
the application function, but perfect is not the goal. Getting it
working in a reliable fashion that is automatic is the main goal.</p>
<p>Fetching the events from google calendar is not the best experience
at the moment. Every few days the token expires and even though I have
refresh tokens it does not seem to work when trying to refresh it
automatically. This might be a skill issue, but with each part of the
system being separate it is straightforward to update each part
individually.</p></main>

            <p>This family event tracker will use <code>n</code> eink
            displays powered by ESP-32. They will display the local
            weather conditions to help us prepare for the day and also
            combine all family member calendar events for the day, or
            week.</p>
            <h2 id="tech">tech</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Go - backend to fetch weather, and events data</li>
            <li>js, html, css - using the gathered information generate
            the ui for the display and create the image that will be
            shown on the eink displays</li>
            <li>C++ - The controller for the eink display that will pull
            in the saved image of the weather and events as a bitmap and
            displays it to the screen.</li>
            <li>imagemagick - Used to convert any screen captured image
            into bmp, and bitmap array. More easily readable by the
            esp32</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="process">process</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Using a cronjob the go application will fetch current
            weather and calendar events ( runs every 15 minutes)</li>
            <li>After fetching the data use playwright to spin up the
            webpage making use of the data to generate the images of
            various sizes that can fit on any eink displays in the
            system</li>
            <li>Process the saved image captured from the webpage to
            ensure that it is a 1-bit bitmap image that can be displayed
            on monochrome e-ink displays</li>
            <li>Every 30 minutes the e-ink displays fetch the saved
            image processes it and draws it to the screen. ( to preserve
            battery power the esp32 goes into deep sleep after this
            process. IT take ~30 seconds. The esp32 does not wake to
            fetch data during the night. Operating hours are between 6am
            and 1am every day)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="concerns">concerns</h2>
            <p>The esp32 is underpowered and low on memory so displaying
            images from a local server comes with challenges as the
            specific boards being used have a max of 500kb of memory to
            work with. So pulling in large image files is not reliable.
            The best option is to stream the data into a bitmap array
            and draw it to the display as it becomes ready. Repeating
            this process until the image is complete.</p>
            <p>Being new to many of the pieces, like C++ and Go it is
            unclear at times if I am taking the most ideal approach to
            writing the code to make the application function, but
            perfect is not the goal. Getting it working in a reliable
            fashion that is automatic is the main goal.</p>
            <p>Fetching the events from google calendar is not the best
            experience at the moment. Every few days the token expires
            and even though I have refresh tokens it does not seem to
            work when trying to refresh it automatically. This might be
            a skill issue, but with each part of the system being
            separate it is straightforward to update each part
            individually.</p>

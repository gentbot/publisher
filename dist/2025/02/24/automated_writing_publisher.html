<p>Concept: Create a system that can take specific markdown files
created in Obsidian and process them into html files that can be
uploaded to the web.</p>
<p>Reason: Seemed like an interesting project</p>

Process
</summary>
<pre><code>1. Use a tool like Pandoc to convert `*.md` files into HTML files.
2. Put the output into a specific folder
3. Commit the changes to that folder and open a pr
4. Have a publishing system watch that repo and push the artifacts to your website whenever there is an update
5. Result. An automated blog style website that will function by continuing to take notes on projects, ideas, current progress, and anything else that is even remotely interesting</code></pre>

<p>This project started today. It seemed like an interesting concept so
it made sense to try and make it happen, because why not? First things
first I had to solidify the general idea. I want to remove as much
friction as possible between myself and publishing writing to my
website. Sure there are many great tools that let you spin up a blog
that does all the things, but I am not really interested in more tools.
Lets just keep it simple. So it made sense to create something that
would be highly automated and effectively a set it and forget it, but it
should be very flexible and have the ability to be updated at any
point.</p>
<p>The core concept centers around being able to make use of a current
practice of writing notes and basic documentation about ideas for
projects and interests in obsidian. These notes have been incredibly
helpful in keeping track of new ideas, progress on projects and learning
new things. Wouldn’t it be great if I could just have them automagically
be published, if and when I wanted them to be made available?</p>
<p>This is where the idea was formed. Using available tools ( cronjobs,
bash, git ) could I create a system that would look through my Obsidian
vault for specific files, convert them to html, organize them into
appropriate folders and push that to the web with no intervention on my
part beyond documenting the project itself? The answer was clearly yes.
The next step was to figure out how I wanted it to work.</p>
<p>Here is what I landed on for a first version:</p>
<ul>
<li>All posts must have some basic control to figure out if it should be
published or ignored.
<ul>
<li>Solution: Use tags. Specifically the tag ( publish )</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All posts must be organized and timestamped
<ul>
<li>Solution: Use Obsidian templates to manage the creation of new notes
and prefill them with timestamp properties and any other bit of useful
metadata information</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All posts must can be edited, but that must be tracked on the system
as well.
<ul>
<li>Solution: Use the same properties concept defined above to have an
edited timestamp that will update automatically and present itself on
the site</li>
<li>Note: Any update or edit should not impact where the post is stored
when converted to html</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Future versions will have other features. Here are a few that I am
currently planning</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic banner image generation based on the content of the post
itself. The system should summarize the text, convert the concept into a
prompt, put that prompt into an image generation pipeline, add a summary
of that image to a banner image alt tag and push the resulting generated
image up with the published page.</li>
<li>Table on contents for the entire project. This too should be
automated and updated with each new post</li>
<li>Category filter or passive search using tags. Each post will have at
least one category/tag associated with it. There should be a very simple
way to select a tag and see all relevant entries related to that
post.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more features and ideas to come, but I think for the moment
this is a great start. And if I want to meet the target of creating this
project within a 24 hour window ( there is no reason for this timebox
other than general curiosity ) I need to move along quite quickly, but
without compromising the core concept or cutting corners. It’s ok to go
fast, but that is no reason to be reckless.</p>

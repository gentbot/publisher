<p>Looking into the current list of tools available in terms of ai.
Currently working on connecting chat, audio generation, image and video
generation ( Automatic1111, comfyui). There are other items but
currently connecting all of these items while also making sure they are
available on a local network via api to help with integrations into
other possible applications is tricky enough.</p>
<p>The immediate fixation is getting comfyui to work. Mostly it is a
skill issue. The process is to slowly get a few useful workflows put
together and make those available one at a time to other
applications.</p>

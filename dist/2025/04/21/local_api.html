                <p>Making a lot of home projects mean there are a large
                number of application folders. All in various states of
                being complete and functioning. It occurred to me that I
                am often doing a lot of boilerplate work to create a
                database, some endpoints, or connect various services
                that are intended for use in a home lab setting. If that
                is the case, why not have a single api application that
                would handle many of the shared services instead. That
                way the management of those services can be in a single
                place and can be easily extended and maintained.</p>

                <li>Lots of opportunities to rush through things without
                doing proper validation or error checking</li>
                <li>API is technically open to anyone on the local
                network. Not a huge concern, but still one that
                exists.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
                <p>The LocalAPI project is a great opportunity to
                create, update, manage and version an api meant for use
                across multiple applications in a specific location.
                Currently the first version is run using Hono. There is
                a need to add a build step and create a near full-time
                running application from the api codebase. It would make
                sense to keep the dev server and the “production” server
                separate. This would also make it more straight forward
                to add some basic access controls to the project like an
                api key for each application ( possibility to make a new
                api key project ). Or make a single api key that is
                available for each connecting device if it is
                authorized.</p>

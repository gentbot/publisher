    <main><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Making a lot of home projects mean there are a large number of
application folders. All in various states of being complete and
functioning. It occurred to me that I am often doing a lot of
boilerplate work to create a database, some endpoints, or connect
various services that are intended for use in a home lab setting. If
that is the case, why not have a single api application that would
handle many of the shared services instead. That way the management of
those services can be in a single place and can be easily extended and
maintained.</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<ul>
<li>TS - Use typescript to code all the endpoints</li>
<li>Hono - A web application framework. Like Express, but different (
read: better )</li>
<li>Bun - A JS runtime. Like Node, but different ( read: better )</li>
<li>Ollama - A local llm runner</li>
<li>Kokoro-FastAPI - A local only text to speech model</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Identify a need across multiple homelab applications</li>
<li>Outline what endpoint is needed to meet the need previously
identified</li>
<li>combine existing endpoints or create a new one to solve the
need</li>
<li>Any new endpoint should get it’s own file. The api manager app
(LocalAPI) is setup to use file base routing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concerns">Concerns</h2>
<ul>
<li>This has the potential to create many one off api endpoints if not
managed correctly</li>
<li>Lots of opportunities to rush through things without doing proper
validation or error checking</li>
<li>API is technically open to anyone on the local network. Not a huge
concern, but still one that exists.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The LocalAPI project is a great opportunity to create, update, manage
and version an api meant for use across multiple applications in a
specific location. Currently the first version is run using Hono. There
is a need to add a build step and create a near full-time running
application from the api codebase. It would make sense to keep the dev
server and the “production” server separate. This would also make it
more straight forward to add some basic access controls to the project
like an api key for each application ( possibility to make a new api key
project ). Or make a single api key that is available for each
connecting device if it is authorized.</p></main>
